# TedX_Registration_Form

I have created a website that contains one form for students, faculty, and other persons to register for TedX events. A person can enter his/her credentials and can register for the respective event. Once it is submitted the page navigates to another website which shows successfully registered option and also gives a chance to fill out a new form.

I have used front-end languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this website.

You can download the files under TX floder and can run in your favourite browser to experience the actual site.
